# Game Time Manager, the Game Timer for Grown Ups

I'm excited to announce Game Time Manager (GTM), a free, open-source tool for managing and tracking your video game sessions on Windows PC. It encourages a healthy relationship with gaming and helps you prioritize the important tasks in your life by periodically displaying an overlay that indicates how long you've been playing. Forthcoming features include historical metrics, rules, and a graphical user interface.

## What makes Game Time Manager unique?

- **GTM is for adults**. Many time trackers are for parents monitoring their kids. More than 95% of PC gamers are over the age of 18, we don't need parental monitoring.
- **GTM is focused on mindfulness**. It encourages awareness of your gaming patterns while you play, while other time trackers simply aggregate historical data.
- **GTM is automated**. The internet is full of advice suggesting players use clocks or manually set timers while they play. _Wut_? You're on your computer. Why are you manually doing anything?
- **GTM works with most games**. It isn't tied to a specific game or launcher. The overlay works with any game that runs in a borderless window. GTM's historical metrics (in development) work with all games.
- **GTM is open source**. You deserve to know what you're installing on your computer.

## Time flies when you're having fun

You may still be wondering why anyone needs a game timer. It's simple: our perception of time changes when we game. It's not about willpower or self-discipline, it's about how our brains work. If you've ever thought you've been playing for an hour, only to discover that it's been two hours, then you know exactly what I mean. Scientists call this phenomenon "time compression". While time compression isn't unique to video gaming, it's definitely a major part of the gaming experience. In fact, it's one of the best parts of the gaming experience; gamers will tell you that the better the gameplay, the more time gets distorted.

Unfortunately, not everything about losing track of time is good. Consider the fact that most PC gamers are adults. Most adults have responsibilities. Most responsibilities require keeping track of time. You can see where this is going. The very nature of gaming makes it difficult to stay mindful of how we're spending our time, which in turn makes it difficult to stay mindful of our responsibilities.

While time distortion impacts all gamers, some people find it especially difficult. People with ADHD, for example, typically suffer from "time blindness" (yes, it's a "thing"). Their brains do not accurately process time, which is challenging under normal conditions, even more so when enthralled by their favorite game. Time distortion can make other people more susceptible to gaming disorders. They may be a vulnerable person gaming more than they think. The more they play, the more habituated their brain becomes to dopamine bursts and hyperstimulation. The more habituated their brains become, the more they want to play. It's a vicious cycle that can lead to truly tragic outcomes.

GTM helps everyone build a sense of self-discipline and control, from those seeking a little more mindfulness to those suffering from time blindness. It won't cure gaming addiction, but it may help prevent addiction in the first place. Ultimately, GTM allows players to manage their time more effectively, prioritize other important tasks in their lives, and develop a healthy relationship with gaming.
 
## How it works

Game Time Manager starts along with your computer. Every few seconds, it checks if Windows is allowing notifications, such as those annoying messages from the System Tray. Because games generally suppress notifications, notification status is a good indication that a game is running. If notifications are suppressed and the window in focus occupies the entire screen, GTM assumes it's a game. It's an imprecise heuristic to be sure, but it works quite well. If you find that GTM is making bad assumptions, you can add applications to the ignore list.

Once GTM thinks a game is running, it periodically displays a small, non-disruptive overlay that indicates how long the game has been running. You can configure where and how long it displays. In general, you shouldn't notice any impact on your machine. Written in a modern, fast, and secure programming language, GTM typically uses less than 10MB of memory and its CPU usage is almost indiscernible. It also runs in its own process, so you don't need to worry about it interfering with your game or mods.

GTM's overlay works with all games that run in Borderless Windowed (BW) mode. Note that what many games call "Fullscreen" is in fact BW. Some older games only run in Fullscreen Exclusive (FSE) mode, but that shouldn't be a problem for most newer titles. If you aren't seeing the overlay, check the game's video options and change to Borderless Windowed. While there is a myth that FSE yields better FPS than BW, the truth is that it all depends on how the game is optimized. Some titles run better in Borderless Windowed, some in FSE, and some run the same in both modes. All that's to say that while you may occasionally have to make graphical changes, the majority of the time GTM will "just work", and in either case, it will work well.
