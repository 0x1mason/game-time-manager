# Game Time Manager

Game Time Manager is a tool for managing the time that you spend gaming on your PC. When it detects that you're playing a game in full-screen, it will periodically show you how long you've been playing. It also tracks your play history. The goal is to give you a tool that helps you balance your gaming with the rest of your life.

## About

### Time flies when you're having fun

When most people game they experience what scientists call "time compression". If you've ever thought you were gaming for an hour only to discover that it's been two hours, then you know exactly what time compression is. Scientists don't know what causes it, but there's no doubt that it's a common part of the gaming experience.

Time compression isn't a bad thing and can be a sign that you're having fun. In fact, lots of people love that when they game, the world seems to drop away. However, it can be challenging to self-regulate your play when your brain has a distorted sense of time. Some people compensate by using alarms and clocks. Others just game until they can't keep their eyes open.

Game Time Manager is a game timer designed to help you track your play time time. By default, it shows your play time for 10 seconds every 10 minutes. You can also use it as a traditional game time tracker to keep data on what and when you play.

Game timers are commonly used in the video gambling industry and there's research suggesting that they work. While video gaming and video gambling push a lot of the same buttons in our brains, the video game industry doesn't commonly provide timers for players.

Game Time Manager fills the gap for Windows PC gamers by offering a single timer that works with the vast majority of games. It runs in the background once your computer starts. It looks for apps running in full-screen mode and begins showing an overlay. ...

### It's all fun and games until someone get hurt

Time compression + dopamine loops + hyper stimulation can put some people at risk for addiction and other pathologies...
